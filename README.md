# AdvanceDataStructure
The   Project   is   divided   into   two   parts.In   Part   1   of   project   we   need   to  
implement   â€‹Dijkstra   Single   source   shortest   algorithm   using   a   Fibonacci.In  
Part   2   of   the   project   we   need   to   implement   a   routing   scheme   (routing)   for  
a   network   .The   data   structure   to   be   used   for   implementing   Part   2   is   Binary  
Trie   and   also   Dijkstra   algorithm   that   was   being   implemented   in   Part1   was  
also used . The   benefit   of   using   Fibonacci   Heap   for   Dijkstra   is   that   the   complexity   of  
algorithm   is   O   (E+VlogV)   time   where   E   is   number   of   edges   in   the   graph  
which   is   better   as   compared   to   using   other   data   structures   like   simple  
heap or array
